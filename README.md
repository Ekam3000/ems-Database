# ems-Database
Developed and deployed a full-stack Employee Management System using React (Vite) for the frontend with React Hooks, Routing via React Router DOM, and Axios for API calls. The backend was built using Spring Boot with RESTful API architecture, performing full CRUD operations and leveraging Lombok for boilerplate reduction. Data is persisted using PostgreSQL. The frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend is deployed on Koyeb, enabling seamless full-stack integration.
